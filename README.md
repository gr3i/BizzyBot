## 📌 Features

* 🔐 **Email Verification** 
  Users must verify their identity using a university email. Only **one user per email address** is allowed. 

* 🎓 **Automatic Role Assignment**
  Upon successful verification, users are granted:

  * A general `Verified` role.
  * A specific role based on their email domain (`VUT` for university emails, `Host` for others).

* 📘 **Subject and Faculty Role Selection**
  Users can select their **subjects** and **faculty affiliation** using reaction-based messages and slash commands.

* ✅ **TODO Onboarding** 
  Right after verification and gaining the VUT role, bot sends a **TODO checklist** via DM to help students navigate the server. 

* 🛠️ **Owner-Only Commands**
  Admins can manage the bot and users via several restricted commands:

  * Send announcements as the bot
  * View user verification status
  * Remove verification and assigned roles
